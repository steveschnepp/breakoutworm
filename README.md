# Breakout Worm

My submission for the [4MB Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/4mb-jam-2025).

Another speedy submission : now with about 8 hours in total.

## Rules

* Left / Right arrow to control the red paddle>
* The worm needs to touch the holes to make them disappear
* Sometimes a wormhole appears, and it teleports the worm.
* You have to make the endpoint of the wormhole disappear to transform the origin hole into a regular one and then you can make it disappear also.
* Each miss on the bottom leads to added holes

The goal is to make all the holes disappear in to reach the next level. Reaching level 32 in the least amount of time wins.

## Special keys

Press P or the Pause key to pause.
Press M or to mute the background music.

Note : there is a cheat key that removes a hole, except for the last one.
